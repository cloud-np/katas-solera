Problem 1 : bounds[j+ 1] != bounds[j+1]   this is wrong

Problem 2 : points.size() this is an array and we should instead use .length

Problem 3 : Doesnt guarantee the return type to be correct.

Problem 4 : start and end variables are not defined

Problem 5 : 0xff represents the value of -1 because Java uses two's complement to represent signed values.

Problem 6 : The types are incompatible, because of lossy conversion from int to byte.
